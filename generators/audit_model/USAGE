Description:
	The audit model generator creates the Audit model in app/models/ associating it with the correct "human" class ("user" by default).

Example:
    ./script/generate audit_model Person

    This will create the Audit model in app/models/ associating it to the Person model.

    You must generate the migration using the same "human" class.
